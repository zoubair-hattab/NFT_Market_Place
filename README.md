# NFT Marketplace

> In this project, I developed a comprehensive blockchain application using Solidity for the backend and ReactJS for the frontend. 
> Ethers served as an intermediary between the backend and frontend, with Redux employed for effective state management. 
> Before conducting any tests, ensure that you have funds in your Spolia test wallet, and then proceed to connect to my project. 
> It is advisable to test the functionality on the Spolia testnet before deploying any live transactions.

> For the uploading of metadata to the NFT, I utilized Pinata along with IPFS.
> for design, I used taillwincss and reactjs

### In the upcoming update,

> dashboard will be added for the platform owner.
> This dashboard will enable the owner to withdraw fees from mining NFTs, check the platform's balance, and adjust the cost of minting.
> All these features have been implemented in the smart contract; only the frontend remains to be developed.
